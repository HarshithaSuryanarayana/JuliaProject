# JuliaProject

OBJECTIVE :
The objective of this project is to solve the classification problem on the identification of Cats and Dogs from by image processing. The training sample contains the images of either Cats or Dogs. 
The classification problem will be solved by using the Convolutional Neural Network technology which will be used via learning algorithm in order classify the given Images. 
The training sample taken to perform the initial training the Neural Network.  

TECHNOLOGY USED:
PYTHON 3.0  TENSOR FLOW 1.0  OPEN CV 3.4.4 

CONCLUSION 
Neural Network was designed which can classify Dogs and Cats in the given Images was achieved by using the Convolution Neural Network. However, there are some inconsistence was observed in classification.
